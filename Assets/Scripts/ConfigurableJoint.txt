IMPORTANT ATTRIBUTES

Rigidbody
	Mass - Determines how light the spring segments are
		
Configurable Joint
	Anchor - Where this joint should stay (probably keep at 0)
	Connected Anchor - Where the connected joint should stay relative to this one (slightly negative y)
	Angular Z Motion - Limited
	
	Angular Z Limit
		Limit - The maximum degrees any given segments can bend
		Bounciness - How much they should bounce once they hit this limit
		
	X Drive
		Position Spring - How much the segments align in the x direction (fairly high)
	Y Drive
		Position Spring - How much the segments align in the y direction (the main slinky direction, also fairly high)
	
	Angular YZ Drive
		Position Spring - How much the spring maintains its angles (fairly low)
